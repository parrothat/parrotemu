# 🦜 ParrotEMU

**ParrotEMU** is an open-source, multiplatform emulator for 8-bit and 16-bit CPUs —  
with planned support for 32-bit, 64-bit, and ARM architectures.  
It runs on both **Windows** and **Linux**, offering a clean and modular design for CPU and system emulation.

Developed under the **ParrotHat Foundation**, ParrotEMU aims to provide an accessible, educational, and high-performance environment for learning how CPUs and low-level systems work.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Emulates 8-bit and 16-bit processors  
✅ Modular design – add new CPU cores easily  
✅ Precise instruction decoding and flags  
✅ Realistic RAM, stack, and I/O simulation  
✅ Runs on Windows and Linux (cross-platform)  
✅ Written in clean, modern **C++17**  
✅ Open-source under **GPLv3**

## 🧠 Planned Features

🔹 Support for 32-bit, 64-bit, and ARM cores  
🔹 Integrated debugger and disassembler  
🔹 Optional GUI for visualizing CPU state  
🔹 Real-time clock and peripheral simulation  
🔹 Plugin system for adding new architectures  
🔹 Integration with ParrotHat’s **OpenATA BIOS** and **ParVirt**
